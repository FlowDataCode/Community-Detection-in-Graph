# Community-Detection-in-Graph

Topic of the work: "Comparison of different methods for identifying communities on lange graph datasets"

* Creating a graph of Russian companies and determining some characteristics of each company
* Using several clustering algorithms, such as the Louvain algorithm, spectral clustering and K-Means
* Building a low-dimensional vector representation for each node of the graph and using methods for clustering embeddings. To obtain embeddings, two methods were used: Node2Vec and link prediction (GCN). Then clustering using K-Menans, Affinity propagation, Mean-shift
